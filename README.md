Hi. This is my attempt to learn Vulkan and write my own engine from scratch.

So far these are my milestones:

5. Resizable window.
4. Rainbow triangular.
3. First triangular.
3. Command buffer created.
2. Fixed compatability issues with MacOS.
1. Vk Instance created, device, logical device, render pass, swapchain initialized.
