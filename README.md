Hi. This is my attempt to learn Vulkan and write my own engine from scratch.

So far these are my milestones:

* Resizable window.
*  Rainbow triangular.
*  My first triangular in VK.
*  Command buffer created.
*  Fixed compatability issues with MacOS.
*  Vk Instance created, device, logical device, render pass, swapchain initialized.
